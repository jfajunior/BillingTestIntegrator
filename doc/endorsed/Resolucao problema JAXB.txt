The crux of this issue is there is a change in the JAXB API, the runtime implementation you are attempting to use does not match the version of the JAXB API bundled with the JDK.

In order to use a different version, you should copy coresponding versions of jaxb-api.jar and jaxws-api.jar into an endorsed lib (e.g. %JAVA_HOME%\lib\endorsed).

A complete list of options is given in section 7.1.2 of the Unofficial JAXB Guide

It is a mistake to copy the implementation jars (e.g. jaxb-impl.jar) into endorsed lib, these should simply be on your classpath.

Also note that you can get into trouble if you attempt to use a newer version of jaxb without also including a compatible version of jaxws. This is because the old jaxws attempts to reference the old jaxb, so if you're changing one make sure you do both. (Stack-trace in package com.sun.xml.internal.ws implicates an old jax-ws implementation. Even the latest release of Java still ships with old version 1 jaxb and jaxws apis).
